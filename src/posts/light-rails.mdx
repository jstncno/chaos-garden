I envisioned this "light rails" idea as a bunch of randomly generated rail lines
in which beams of color changing light rapidly traverse over. Coincidentally,
I have also been wanting to implement the
[Wave Function Collapse](https://www.gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/)
algorithm in a generative art piece. **Light Rails** is the result of me trying
to put these two things together.

I didn't particularly like implementing WVC - in this case, I think my adjacency
rules were too constrained, and what I was wanting to create was quite specific,
so I found myself coding up a bunch of different edge- and corner-cases (there
are probably better ways to implement this so I wouldn't have to keep track of
all these cases, but I'm not that clever).

There are obviously also other techniques and approaches to implementing WVC,
so I'll have to keep these things in mind the next time I go about it. One
interesting thing I did, though, was to collapse the grid starting from the
center, then spiraling out (instead of a typical `for`-loop iterating up-down
and left-right). Using this technique, I found that it was less likely for
generated paths to have a closed loop.
