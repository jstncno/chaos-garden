  Have you ever looked up at the stars and wondered how it would be if humans
  were a spacefaring species?

  Watching enough sci-fi movies inspired me to create this warp speed effect.

  This effect is created by generating a bunch of dots as stars traveling
  outwardly from the center, extending their length and acceleration when
  warp speed is toggled on.

  Created with [CodeSandbox][codesandbox] using [p5.js][p5js].
