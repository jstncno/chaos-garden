  I've always been a fan of outer space and science fiction, and watching enough
  sci-fi movies that take place in space inspired me to create this warp speed
  effect.

  This effect is created by generating a bunch of dots as stars traveling
  outwardly from the center, extending their length and acceleration when
  warp speed is toggled on.

  Created with [CodeSandbox][codesandbox] using [p5.js][p5js].
